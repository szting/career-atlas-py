## Recent Fixes and Updates

### Fix 1: Password Authentication (Completed)

**Issue**: Password authentication page was not displaying in the Preview.

**Root Cause**: The password in the authentication check had a typo ("Cl@r1tyC2r33r" instead of "Cl@r1tyC2r3r").

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed the password string in `utils/simple_auth.py` to match the required password: "Cl@r1tyC2r3r"
- The authentication system now properly displays the login form when users are not authenticated
- Session management includes a 30-minute timeout for security
- The login form is centered and styled for better user experience

**How it works**:
1. When the app loads, `check_simple_password()` is called in `app.py`
2. If the user is not authenticated, the function displays the login form and returns `False`
3. The `st.stop()` command in `app.py` prevents the rest of the app from loading until authentication succeeds
4. Upon successful authentication, the session is marked as authenticated and the app reloads to show the main content

### Fix 2: RIASEC Results in Analytics Panel (Completed)

**Issue**: RIASEC results were not updating in the analytics panel after completing an assessment.

**Root Cause**: The analytics panel was checking for the existence of `riasec_scores` in session state but wasn't properly validating if the scores had actual values (they were initialized as 0).

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `pages/admin_panel.py` to check if RIASEC scores have actual values (> 0) rather than just checking if the dictionary exists
- Added proper validation for all assessment data (RIASEC, skills, values)
- Improved the completion rate calculation to reflect actual progress
- Added debug information to help troubleshoot data flow issues
- Fixed API key storage reference to use the correct session state structure

**Key Changes**:
1. Changed from `st.session_state.get('riasec_scores')` to checking if any score > 0
2. Added `has_riasec_data`, `has_skills_data`, and `has_values_data` boolean flags
3. Updated metrics calculations to use these flags
4. Fixed decimal display for RIASEC scores (now shows as X.X/5)
5. Added debug section showing session state keys for troubleshooting

**How it works**:
1. When a user completes the RIASEC assessment, scores are stored in `st.session_state.riasec_scores`
2. The analytics panel now checks if any of these scores are greater than 0 (indicating actual assessment data)
3. Only when valid data exists does the panel display the results and update metrics
4. The completion rate now accurately reflects which assessments have been completed
