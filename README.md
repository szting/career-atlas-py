## Customizing Career Frameworks

### Career Paths

The career paths database is defined in `data/careers.py`. Each career entry follows this structure:

```python
{
    'id': 'unique-identifier',
    'title': 'Career Title',
    'description': 'Brief description of the career',
    'primary_type': 'primary-riasec-type',  # One of: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, conventional
    'secondary_type': 'secondary-riasec-type',  # Optional secondary RIASEC type
    'required_skills': ['Skill1', 'Skill2', 'Skill3'],  # List of key skills
    'work_environment': ['Environment1', 'Environment2'],  # Work settings
    'salary_range': '$X - $Y',  # Typical salary range
    'growth_outlook': 'Growth projection',  # Job market outlook
    'education': 'Required education'  # Typical education requirements
}
```

To customize:
1. Add new career entries following the structure above
2. Ensure each career has a unique `id`
3. Assign appropriate RIASEC types as `primary_type` and `secondary_type`
4. List required skills that match or closely relate to skills in the skills assessment
5. Include relevant work environments that might align with work values

**Important**: The career matching algorithm in `utils/career_matcher.py` uses the RIASEC types, required skills, and work environment to calculate matches. Ensure these fields are properly populated for accurate matching.

### RIASEC Questions

RIASEC assessment questions are defined in a separate file (not shown in the provided code). The expected structure is:

```python
riasec_questions = [
    {
        'id': 'question-id',
        'text': 'Question text',
        'type': 'riasec-type'  # One of: realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, conventional
    },
    # More questions...
]
```

To customize:
1. Maintain a balanced number of questions for each RIASEC type
2. Ensure questions clearly reflect the characteristics of their assigned type
3. Keep questions concise and easy to understand
4. Avoid biased language that might favor certain demographics

### Skills Assessment

The skills assessment framework should be organized by categories:

```python
skills_categories = [
    {
        'name': 'Category Name',
        'skills': ['Skill 1', 'Skill 2', 'Skill 3']
    },
    # More categories...
]
```

To customize:
1. Group related skills into logical categories
2. Keep skill names concise and specific
3. Include skills relevant to various career paths in your database
4. Ensure a balanced representation across different fields

### Work Values

Work values are defined as a list of options with descriptions:

```python
work_values = [
    {
        'name': 'Value Name',
        'description': 'Brief description of the value'
    },
    # More values...
]
```

To customize:
1. Include a diverse range of work values
2. Provide clear, concise descriptions
3. Ensure values align with the keywords used in the career matching algorithm
4. Consider cultural and generational differences in work values

### Coaching Questions

Coaching questions are defined in `data/coaching_questions.py` with the following structure:

```python
coaching_questions = [
    {
        'id': 'question-id',
        'category': 'category-name',  # e.g., exploration, development, goal-setting, reflection
        'riasecFocus': 'riasec-type',  # The RIASEC type this question targets
        'question': 'The main coaching question',
        'purpose': 'Brief explanation of the question purpose',
        'followUp': ['Follow-up question 1', 'Follow-up question 2']  # Optional follow-up questions
    },
    # More questions...
]
```

To customize:
1. Create questions for each RIASEC type and category
2. Ensure questions are open-ended and thought-provoking
3. Include a clear purpose for each question
4. Add relevant follow-up questions to deepen the conversation
5. Use language appropriate for coaching conversations

## File Upload System

The admin panel includes a file upload system for updating the career frameworks. When uploading files:

1. Files must be in the correct format (JSON or Python)
2. The system validates the structure of uploaded files
3. Templates are available for download to ensure correct formatting
4. Uploaded files replace the existing frameworks after validation

File upload templates follow the structures outlined in the customization sections above.

## API Integration

The application can integrate with OpenAI's API for enhanced coaching responses. To configure:

1. Access the Admin Panel
2. Navigate to the API Settings section
3. Enter your OpenAI API key
4. Test the connection before saving
5. Configure fallback responses for when the API is unavailable

The API integration enhances the coaching experience by generating personalized follow-up questions and insights based on the user's RIASEC profile and responses.

## Development Notes

### Adding New Career Paths

When adding new career paths, ensure they include:

1. Accurate RIASEC type classifications
2. Skills that match or closely relate to the skills assessment options
3. Work environment descriptions that contain keywords related to work values
4. Comprehensive metadata (salary, education, growth outlook)

The career matching algorithm weighs RIASEC alignment at 40%, skills matching at 35%, and work values alignment at 25%.

### Extending the Assessment

To add new assessment types:

1. Create a new page module in the `pages` directory
2. Define the assessment questions/items in the `data` directory
3. Update the session state initialization in `utils/session_state.py`
4. Add the new step to the navigation flow in `app.py`
5. Update the career matching algorithm if needed
